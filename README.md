## SWFS 2019 Workshop

This repository contains R code behind the **wildlifedetectR** shiny app. **wildlifedetectR** is an interactive user-friendly tool for undertaking key wildlife forensic and population genetic analyses. The purpose of wildlife detectR is to streamline and standardize the analytical methods typically used in wildlife forensics. The program can generate statistics and reports for individualisation, parentage and species identification tests. Both traditional and genomic markers can be used. It can also be used to generate population genetic statistics and undertake marker filtering to aid in the design of wildlife forensic tools.

Running the app
-----------
###### Option 1: Local installation üíª
To run the app locally yourself, download this repository by clicking **Clone or download** followed by **Download ZIP.** Unzip the directory onto your computer and open the file `shiny.Rproj` in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). You will need to have installed R, Rstudio and the packages listed in the `global.R` script. To run the app, open the `server.R` script and click **Run.**

###### Option 2: RStudio Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è
Alternatively, you can run the app using [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). To do this, first sign up for an RStudio Cloud account and then use [this link](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/18204/join?access_code=80mN%2B4%2BqQcoodt8ADj0sXWQxkBB7hYq7I5MjYQ8L) to access the SWFS 2019 workspace. Open the **shiny_wildlifedetectR** project and run the app as above. It might take some time to deploy, just be patient. There is no need to have installed anything on your laptop to use this option.

###### Option 3: Web-based üåê
The app may also be available to run [here](https://elhumble.shinyapps.io/wildlifedetectr) although there are currently restrictions on the number of concurrent users. **We only recommend this if all other options fail.**
